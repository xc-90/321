Main Ideas:
Gameshow that will have a teacher as a host deciding which questions to show to students. 
Will have a audience and contestants.
Contestants will be a group of two random students who will recieve a question from the teacher and will have to come up with the best response.
Audience will also recieve the same question but they will get 4 multiple choice answers instead of having to type an answer.
At the end of a round (30 seconds long) the answer will be revealed and the audience will get points for choosing the right multiple choice answer.
The audience will be given 10 seconds to vote for who they think has the best answer to the question, person with the most votes gets points.
Two game rounds where all students will go up at least once.
Each round will have 11 different possible questions (22 in total)
Person with the most points at the end wins
Give teacher 10 seconds to help students with the questions through game chat
